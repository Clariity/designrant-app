          I try to remain a positive person but being English, I occassionally
          need to complain. This site is a place for me to vent about some of
          the user interfaces and experiences that drive me insane.

          I 'd like to point out that while I can be quite negative here, I also
          think that there are plenty of examples out there where people have
          built awesome, friendly and beautiful user interfaces. Perhaps in the
          future I will build a site dedicated to these too.
