# Design Rant

We all try to remain positive people but occassionally we need to complain. This site is a place to vent about some of the user interfaces and experiences that drive us all insane.

I 'd like to point out that while we can be quite negative here, we also think that there are plenty of examples out there where people have built awesome, friendly and beautiful user interfaces. Perhaps in the future we will build a site dedicated to these too.
